## WHATS NEW IN SUPER-PATCH 0.6!

**NEW**

Well, we added a new feature that can auto wipe tmp when a session is ended, this is disabled to Default as it Proves on Termux Mobile users and Desktop ones kinda go oopsie when they use the script, leading to tmpfiles lost,and also potentially having issues building the Super Image FIles.
