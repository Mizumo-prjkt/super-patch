GSI HOW

IF YOU'RE DONE EXTRACTING SUPER, THEN THIS OPTION IS AVAILABLE
BUT YOU MAY NEED TO DECLARE FULL DIRECTORY LOCATION OF THE GSI

FOR WINDOWS

IF THE FILE WAS LOCATED IN DOWNLOADS
THIS CAN BE THE DIRECTORY
/mnt/c/Users/Admin/Downloads/pixel_exp.img 

FOR ANDROID

IF THE FILE WERE THEORETICALLY LOCATED AT DOWNLOAD
/storage/emulated/0/Download/lineage_light20.img

DO NOT SELECT THE FILE IN .7Z, THE GSI MUST BE EXTRACTED TO .IMG INSIDE
COMPRESSED FILE TO CONTINUE

YOU CAN ALSO JUST DO IT MANUALLY AFTER EXTRACTING SUPER
FIRST DELETE THE STOCK SYSTEM.IMG THEN
JUST COPY THE GSI IMG TO THE DIRECTORY LOCATION
THEN RENAME IT TO SYSTEM.IMG 

MAKE SURE ITS EXTRACTED IMG NOT THE RENAMED 7Z OR ELSE YOUR PHONE WILL BREAK IN FLASHING
