HOW TO PUT AP IN THE SUPER-PATCH!



TO PUT AP IN THE SUPER PATCH
YOU NEED TO PUT IT ON A DESIGNATED $LAB DIRECTORY

IN TERMUX, IT MAY BE LOCATED AT THE /sdcard/image_build
(AS LONG AS YOU GAVE TERMUX FILE PERMISSIONS AT SETTINGS)

AND FOR WSL, ITS USUALLY LOCATED AT THE SAME DIRECTORY OF THE SCRIPT

CHECK THE MAIN MENU TO LOCATE THE $LAB IN THE CONFIGURATION

BUT IF YOU ARE USING MAGISKED AP, THE SCRIPT MAY STRUGGLE TO FIND IT 
AND ITS BETTER TO EXTRACT THE SUPER MANUALLY
